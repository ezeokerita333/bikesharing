# Results
As Seen in my challenge story workbook on tableau public : "https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ezeoke.rita/viz/Challengestory"

Graph 1 - A line graph displaying the number of bikes checked out by duration for all users, which can also be filtered by the hour.
Graph 2 - A line graph displaying the number of bikes that are checked out by duration for each gender by the hour, which can also be filtered by the hour and the gender.
Graph 3 - A heatmap showing the number of bike trips for each hour of each day of the week.
Graph 4 - A heatmap showing the number of bike trips by gender, for each hour of each day of the week, which can also be filtered by the gender.
Graph 5 - A heatmap showing the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender, for each day of the week, which can also be filtered by the user and the gender.
Graph 6 - A bar chart showing the number of bike trips for each hour of each day of the week(from the module).
Graph 7 - A pie chart showing the ratio of gender to the number of bike trips taken(from the module).

# Summary
Graph 1 - This line graph showed the user checkout in minutes and hours for just the first three time durations, this further shows the higest bikes checkout in the hour '0'.
Graph 2 - This line graph mainly shows the user checkout based on hours duration and gender, this also further shows that the higest bike checkout by gender was the 'male' gender and the lowest were unknown genders. 
Graph 3 - This heatmap showed the most heat of bikes used based on the hours and the days of the week, this further shows the most heat at around 4pm-7pm weekdays.
Graph 4 - This heatmap went further to show to the bikes used based on the hours, the days of the week and the gender with the male gender having the most heat.
Graph 5 - This heatmap also showed the bikes used based on the hours, the days of the week and the gender according to the customer and subscriber user type where the subcriber user type had the highest heat point.
Graph 6 -This is a bar chart from the module showing the highest point of bikes count based on its hours where the highest hour is at 4pm-7pm.
Graph 7 -This is a pie chart from the module showing ratio of gender to the number of bike count where the highest number of bike count is the male gender.
This summary of the all graphs resulted in mostly showing that the males where using more of the bikes in NY city. However, other variables in the data set given could have been considered in determining a more detailed information with the time, gender and user type to avoid any bias. Variable examples could include:    - the start station id and station names.
            - the end station id and station names.
